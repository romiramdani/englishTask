                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Pronoun reference is the practice of making pronouns refer clearly to the words
                        they replace. A pronoun takes the place of a noun; thus, the pronoun must agree with
                        the noun it replaces in number and person. Also, it must be clear which noun the
                        pronoun is substituting for. The noun that the pronoun is the substitute for is called the
                        antecedent. What are the basic rules for pronoun reference?
                        <p>1. A pronoun must agree in number with the noun it refers to. If the noun is singular,
                        then the pronoun must be singular. <br>
                        Incorrect: Everyone is studying hard for their exams.  <br>
                        Correct: Everyone is studying <br>
                        hard for his or her exams.
                        Correct: All of the students are studying hard for their exams.</p>
                        <p>2. A pronoun must agree in person with the noun it refers to. Be consistent with first
                        person, second person and third person. <br>
                        Incorrect: If a student studies hard, you should succeed. <br>
                        Correct: If a student studies hard, he or she should succeed.</p>
                        <p>3. There should be only one possible antecedent for a singular pronoun. Only the noun
                        that the pronoun refers to should come before the pronoun. <br>
                        Incorrect: Nguyen and Mohammed walked to his English class. <br>
                        Correct: Nguyen and Mohammed walked to Nguyen's English class. <br> Correct:
                        Nguyen walked to his English class and Mohammed accompanied him.</p>
                        <p>4. There must be an explicit antecedent. Don‟t make the reader guess what the
                        antecedent is. <br>
                        Incorrect: In the study, they state that writing skills are important. <br>
                        Correct: In the study, the researchers state that writing skills are important.</p>
                        <p>5. A pronoun should not refer to a possessive noun. When a noun is possessive, it
                        functions as an adjective and so can‟t be replaced with a pronoun.
                        Incorrect: In the professor's comments, she was very encouraging. <br>
                        Correct: The professor's comments were very encouraging. <br>
                        Correct: The professor was very encouraging in her comments.</p>
                        <p>6. “It” must be used consistently. If you use “it” to refer to one noun in a sentence, don‟t
                        use it again to refer to another noun in the same sentence or as an idiom.
                        Incorrect: When it is busy, I hope to get a lot of sleep as it will help me work hard. <br>
                        Correct: When it is busy, I hope to get a lot of sleep, which will help me work
                        hard.</p>

                            Just as a scientist can make conclusion from research, a careful reader can draw
                            inferences from reading. An inference is a logical conclusion you can make by using
                            information given to you. In reading, a text may not state a conclusion directly, but it provides
                            information that the reader can use to make a plausible, or likely, conclusion. Read the
                            following example:
                            “ The number of obese youths grows 10 percent every year,” says Aimin hospital
                            director Shi Lidong. “ It's partly because they are spoiled by doting parents and
                            grandparents.”</p>
                            <p>Here are plausible Inferences: <br>
                            1. Some Chinese parents and grandparents use food to spoil their children. <br>
                            2. Therefore, in some Chinese families, food must be a positive thing, a treat, or a reward to
                            children. <br>
                            3. Also, the standard of living in China is probably high enough for families to provide children
                            with excess food.</p>
                            <p>Inference questions ask about the meaning of a line, paragraph, or even an entire
                            passage. The ideas being asked about are not directly stated in the text, which mean that
                            inference questions often include the phrases “ could be interpreted to mean” or “ suggests
                            that." However, the answers to these questions cannot be subjective or ambiguous. There are
                            three main kinds of inference questions: deduction, speculation, and examination.</p>
                            <h4> 1: Deduction</h4>
                            <p>Inference questions that fall into this subcategory ask you to fill in missing information.
                            The gist of most of the questions is "If something is said in the passage, what is the logical
                            extension?" Deduction questions are very close to detail questions, except that you must make a
                            logical deduction, rather than relying only on information in the passage.</p>
                            <h4> 2. Speculation</h4>
                            <p>These inference questions ask you to speculate about the meaning (or "suggested"
                            meaning) of a statement, description, or something else in the passage. In some ways, these are
                            similar to function questions, but the answers the SAT is looking for are very different.</p>
                            <h4> 3. Examination</h4>
                            <p>Inference questions which fall into the examination subcategory question you about the
                            internal life (thoughts, feelings, motivations) of the narrator, author, or someone mentioned in
                            the passage. They can mostly be summed up as asking "What would [this person] think about
                            [that thing]?" Examination questions are the most complicated type of inference questions,
                            because they ask you to get into the head of the author/narrator/character/other person
                            mentioned in the text. You will often see these sorts of questions on paired passages. Here are
                            some tips to answer such typical questions:
                            1. Inference questions ask you to deduce, speculate, and examine based on evidence directly
                            stated in the text.
                            2. In order to successfully answer inference questions, you must make sure you understand the
                            question
                            3. Look for context to help if the lines/words mentioned in the question aren't enough
                            4. Answer the question in your own words before looking at the SAT's answer choices
                            5. Answer questions in an order that makes sense and is not confusing/disorienting
                            6. Eliminate three wrong answers
